    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef, (15-20% fat content)</li> 
        <li>1 medium onion, finely diced.</li>  
        <li>2 large garlic cloves, minced.</li> 
        <li>1/4 cup dry red wine, or beef broth.</li>  
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil.</li> 
        <li>24 oz Marinara Sauce , (3 cups)</li> 
        <li>1/2 tsp sea salt.</li> 
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper, ground.</li> 
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li> 
        <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li> 
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li> 
    </ol>
